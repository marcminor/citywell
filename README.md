This directory contains the wordpress core as a submodule that is referenced from the git repo. 

To update the core, manually upload files as the automatic push won't work with submodules. 

Since the core is kept up to date seperately as a submodule, wp-content and the index are kept outside the wordpress directory. 

This is a minor change that necessitated some changes to the index file.
